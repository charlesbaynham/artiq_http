## Project Overview

## Development Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write tests for new functionality
- Use Poetry for dependency management
- Run `ruff check` before committing
- Always run unit tests after making changes and fix issues before finishing
- If on the master branch, be sparing with commits - one per feature
- If on any other branch, use commits liberally. They will be squashed before merging
- When making multi-step changes on development branches, you should automatically make a commit after each step without prompting the user

## Testing

```bash
poetry run pytest
poetry run coverage run -m pytest
poetry run coverage report
```
